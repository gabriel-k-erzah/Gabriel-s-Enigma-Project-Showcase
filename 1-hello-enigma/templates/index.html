                I’m a Black British Gen Z developer from Teesside, now studying Computer Science at Newcastle.
                I love building things that are fast, useful, and actually respect the people using them.

                This page is a small intro to who I am, what drives me, and a few projects that got me
                excited enough to apply for a placement with you.

        <h2>My story in a few lines</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in the North-East in a mix of UK and Zambian culture, which taught me early on that
            tech should open doors, not close them. I’ve worked part-time in fast-paced kitchens and front-line
            customer roles, so I care a lot about real people, not just clean code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now I’m focused on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building <strong>reliable tools</strong> that still work when things break (like offline AI).</li>
            <li>Learning how <strong>systems behave under pressure</strong> – from networks to people.</li>
            <li>Growing as a developer in an environment where I can ask questions, ship things, and make an impact.</li>
        </ul>
