# Gabriel-s-Enigma-Project-Showcase
A collection of personal projects to try show my creativity, curiosity, offline AI exploration, early quantum programming steps, and passion for using technology to make a positive impact.

# Enigma Showcase — Gabriel Erzah

Welcome to my Enigma Showcase repo. I built this to give you a clear view of the kind of developer I am and the types of things I enjoy exploring. Each project here shows a different side of how I think, learn, and approach ideas.

I hope all these pieces come together to show that I’m creative, analytical, curious, and passionate about using technology to make a positive and meaningful impact.

## Guide to the Three Projects

This repo is split into three main sections, each showing a different part of my journey.

---

### 1. Hello Enigma (Python + Flask)
Folder: /1-hello-enigma

A small web project built specifically for Enigma. It uses a simple Flask backend and a clean frontend to introduce who I am. The main aim is to show some personality, structure, and how I build small web apps in Python.

What it shows:
- Clear and simple communication
- Basic OOP structure
- Clean web app setup with routes and templates
- A personal, human touch

### 2. Offline AI (CLI Project)
Folder: /2-offline-ai-cli

This idea started after the Cloudflare outage. It was funny to watch from the outside, but it also made me realise how dependent everything is on the cloud. That pushed me to explore offline AI and how lightweight tools can work without relying on online resources.

This eventually led me to think about an offline AI-powered calculator. In some areas of Zambia, public schools may have around a 50:1 student-to-calculator ratio. If I could eventually build something low-cost and genuinely helpful, that would mean a lot. Of course, there’s more to consider than just “give them an AI calculator,” but thinking about impact like this motivates me.

What it shows:
- Curiosity and willingness to explore new ideas
- Thinking about efficiency and offline systems
- Considering real-world impact
- Early product-thinking mindset

### 3. Quantum Exploration (Shor’s Algorithm Foundations)
Folder: /3-quantum-exploration

This section covers my early steps into quantum programming. I’m starting with the basics and learning the concepts behind Shor’s algorithm. My focus is understanding qubits, gates, circuits, and the logic involved before trying anything more advanced.

What it shows:
- Interest in new and challenging areas
- Long-term curiosity
- Learning beyond my current skill set
- Building a strong foundation first

## Purpose of This Repository

I built this specifically for my application to the Enigma 12-Month Developer Placement (2026/27). My goal is to show:

- how I approach learning
- how I break down ideas
- how I explore new concepts
- and how I aim to use technology in positive and meaningful ways

Thanks for taking the time to go through everything.
I’m looking forward to the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute at Enigma.
