# Gabriel-s-Enigma-Project-Showcase
A collection of personal projects to try show my creativity, curiosity, offline AI exploration, early quantum programming steps, and passion for using technology to make a positive impact.

# Enigma Showcase — Gabriel Erzah

Welcome to my Enigma Showcase repo. I built this to give you a clear view of the kind of developer I am and the types of things I enjoy exploring. Each project here shows a different side of how I think, learn, and approach ideas.

I hope all these pieces come together to show that I’m creative, analytical, curious, and passionate about using technology to make a positive and meaningful impact.

## Guide to the Three Projects

This repo is split into three main sections, each showing a different part of my journey.

---

### 1. Hello Enigma (Python + Flask)
Folder: /1-hello-enigma

A small web project built specifically for Enigma. It uses a simple Flask backend and a clean frontend to introduce who I am. The main aim is to show some personality, structure, and how I build small web apps in Python.

What it shows:
- Clear and simple communication
- Basic OOP structure
- Clean web app setup with routes and templates
- A personal, human touch

### 2. Offline AI (CLI Project)
Folder: /2-offline-ai-cli

This idea started after the Cloudflare outage. It was funny to watch from the outside, but it also made me realise how dependent everything is on the cloud. That pushed me to explore offline AI and how lightweight tools can work without relying on online resources.

This eventually led me to think about an offline AI-powered calculator. In some areas of Zambia, public schools may have around a 50:1 student-to-calculator ratio. If I could eventually build something low-cost and genuinely helpful, that would mean a lot. Of course, there’s more to consider than just “give them an AI calculator,” but thinking about impact like this motivates me.

What it shows:
- Curiosity and willingness to explore new ideas
- Thinking about efficiency and offline systems
- Considering real-world impact
- Early product-thinking mindset

### 3. Quantum Exploration — Building an ASCII Quantum Debugger
Folder: /3-quantum-exploration

This is the part of the repo I'm most excited about.

Most people learning quantum computing start with Jupyter notebooks or textbook diagrams.  
I decided to take a different approach:

I’m building a **real-time ASCII Quantum Debugger** — a terminal-based tool that visualises qubit behaviour, Bloch sphere movement, superposition, and measurement collapse *live* using nothing but Python and character graphics.

Think of it like a “quantum game engine” for the terminal.

What it does so far:
- draws a real-time ASCII Bloch sphere  
- animates the qubit's state vector  
- shows collapse with a flickering arrow (0 ↔ 1)  
- shows expectation value stabilising over time  
- resizes dynamically with the terminal  
- simulates measurement statistics  

Why I built it:
- I wanted to actually **see** quantum behaviour, not just read it
- I wanted to build tools, not only run examples
- I enjoy turning abstract concepts into interactive visual systems

I wanted to show this because:
- it's original (as far as I know, I could find anything)  
- it mixes physics + rendering + simulation  
- it’s educational and practical  
- it shows systems-level thinking  
- and it’s the foundation for a full quantum debugger I'm planning  

This project is a long-term build, and the current version is just the start.  
But it’s already taught me more about quantum states than any textbook ever did.

## Purpose of This Repository

I built this specifically for my application to the Enigma 12-Month Developer Placement (2026/27). My goal is to show:

- how I approach learning
- how I break down ideas
- how I explore new concepts
- and how I aim to use technology in positive and meaningful ways

Thanks for taking the time to go through everything.
I’m looking forward to the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute at Enigma.
